    <p>Not just for fuzzy blue monsters anymore, people!</p>

      They may not be as tasty as Grandma used to make them, but they are almost
      as popular these days! A cookie, at least in our world, is a 
      <strong>tiny file</strong> 
      placed on your device that <strong>allows us to remember you</strong> and
      make your next visit easier and more efficient.

    <Header as="h2">What Kinds of Cookies Does Quizdini Use and Why?</Header>
    <p>
      Unlike many sites, Quizdini uses only what are called{" "}
      <strong>session cookies</strong>, which{" "}
      <strong>do not collect personally-identifying information</strong>. These
      guys are kind of like those oatmeal raisin classics: still a cookie, but
      almost good for you! These session cookies <strong>help you stay logged in</strong> to your
      account while you work.

    <p>
      In case you were wondering about advertising, let's put your mind at ease
      about <em>those</em> cookies for a moment. Since we don't allow
      advertising on Quizdini, you <strong>never have to worry</strong> about what crazy third party rando is
      hovering in the dark shadows, just waiting to steal your info. We
      apologize if that comes as a disappointment, but it's just not our thing.
